# Exploring Second-Hand Car Sales Data with ML models and Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

Image classification project using TensorFlow and Keras to train and evaluate CNN models on a flower dataset. Explores multiple model configurations with data augmentation, dropout, and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

## Contents
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with code and results
- `reports/`: Final report with problem statement, methodology, and results
- `datasets/`: Contains the car sales dataset, the flower directory can be found from the link below.
